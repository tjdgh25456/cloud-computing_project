
## NEW:

Want to bring Teachable Machine into your own web creations?

We’re working on a library called _teachablemachine.js_ which will let you do just that. Here’s the first remixable demo you can play with to get a sneak peek at what’s possible:

[Hello Wizard](http://glitch.com/edit/#!/tm-wizard?path=README.md%3A1%3A0) - This demo shows how you can drop a machine learning “training wizard” on top of your website with just a few lines of code.

### What is Teachable Machine?

[Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/) is a web-based tool that makes creating machine learning models fast, easy, and accessible for everyone. [You can try it here](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/).

### Who is it for?
Educators, artists, students, innovators, makers of all kinds – really, anyone who has an idea they want to explore. No prerequisite machine learning knowledge required.

### How does it work?
You train a computer to recognize your images, sounds, and poses without writing any machine learning code. Then, use your model in your own projects, sites, apps, and more.

### What is this repository for?

This repository contains two components of [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/):

1. **A [libraries](/libraries) section** that contains all of the machine learning code used in Teachable Machine. Under the hood we use [Tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js), a library for machine learning in Javascript, to train and run the models you make in your web browser. The `libraries` section also contains the API for [image](/libraries/image), [audio](/libraries/audio), and [pose](/libraries/pose) helper libraries that make it easier to use the models exported by Teachable Machine in your own projects.

2. **A [snippets](/snippets) section** that contains markdown snippets that are being displayed inside the export panel in [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/). These snippets contain code and instructions on how to use the exported models from Teachable Machine in languages like Javascript, Java and Python.
